        Welcome to the Global Asset Management Committee (GAMC) workshop in Atlanta! 
        This committee was developed to congregate Oxfordâ€™s global Asset Management 
        leaders to coordinate on strategy, to respond to organizational and market needs, 
        and to enable transparent information-sharing across our global portfolio.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-base font-light lg:text-lg text-slate-800">
        GAMC 2022 will focus on getting broader agreement on the development and implementation 
        of a Value Creation solution to continue to maximize the potential of our assets, as well
        as to align on key performance indicators. Weâ€™ve elected to host this GAMC in Atlanta to 
        help better acquaint GAMC members with IDI, an Oxford-invested Industrial platform 
        headquartered in the city, and to provide the team an opportunity to meet and form 
        connections with our partners, tour innovative assets, and to learn more about their business.
